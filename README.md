# go-semantic-router

Go Semantic Router is a superfast decision-making layer for your LLMs and agents. Rather than waiting for slow LLM generations to make tool-use decisions, we use the magic of semantic vector space to make those decisions â€” routing our requests using semantic meaning.


A pure-go package for computing similarity scores between a query vector embedding and a set of vector embeddings.

## Installation

```bash
go get github.com/conneroisu/go-semantic-router
```

## Usage

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"github.com/conneroisu/go-semantic-router"
	"github.com/conneroisu/go-semantic-router/providers"
)

var PoliticsRoutes = semantic_router.Routes {
	Name: "politics",
	Utterances: []string{
		"isn't politics the best thing ever",
		"why don't you tell me about your political opinions",
		"don't you just love the president",
		"they're going to destroy this country!",
		"they will save the country!",
	},
}

var ChitchatRoutes = semantic_router.Routes {
	Name: "chitchat",
	Utterances: []string{
		"how's the weather today?",
		"how are things going?",
		"lovely weather today",
		"the weather is horrendous",
		"let's go to the chippy",
	},
}

func main() {
    router := semantic_router.NewRouter(
		[]semantic_router.Routes{PoliticsRoutes, ChitchatRoutes},
		providers.OpenAIEncoder{os.Getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")}
    )
    finding, err := router.Evaluate("how's the weather today?")
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error:", err)
    }
    fmt.Println("Found:", finding)
}
```

Output:

```
Found: politics
```
