// Package semanticrouter is a package for abstractly computing similarity scores between a query vector embedding and a set of vector embeddings.
//
// It provides a simple key-value store for embeddings and a router that can be used to find the best route for a given utterance.
//
// The router uses a similarity score to determine the best route for a given utterance.
//
// The semantic router is designed to be used in conjunction with LLMs and agents to provide a superfast decision-making layer.
